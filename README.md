Optimizing user's search queries for personalized web results (Twitter, Medium)


Optimizing search results, though an important component
of the internet and the web world, is relatively less
discussed in research and practice. Few scholars have
identified that search can be time and money consuming
- and this can be appalling if users are unsuccessful in
obtaining desired results in the process. Research on personalized
search aggregation have also been used mainly
for marketing and business purpose. The common method
in the field is ranking users preference and matching output
that serves recommendation systems. However, single
user-independent ranking model are often insufficient
to satisfy different usersâ€™ result preferences. I propose a
transfer learning, the project creates word embeddings for
the universe of search queries and a model that assign labels
to new ones. This labels will be synchronized with
personalized and optimized search histories to give better
results for academic recommendations than standard
search engines. The search query data with COVID-19
intent will be used for this analysis
